I would like to thank my supervisor Dr. Zheng Wang for the support and
continued feedback throughout the year. I would also like to thank my assesor
Dr. Karim Djemame and my personal tutor Dr. David head for the timely and
informative feedback and help session. Finally, I would like to express
gratitude towards all my friends and family for the continuous support in all
non-technical aspects of this project.
