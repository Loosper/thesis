    Intertwined with design, but a few things are impl only. Here they are

    \section{FUSE module}

    \section{Filesystem}

    \section{Redundancy}

    \section{Bootstrap}

        Need to init the free list first and allocate it fully. It's small tho and easy to setup

    \section{version control and good practices?}
